1. According to Brooks' illustration, essential difficulties are the inevitable difficulties caused by the inherent properties of software systems, and met when developers try to construct conceptual solutions from abstract problems. For example, it is difficult to build a robot that behaves like human.

1. Accidental difficulties are those difficulties met when developers try to implement the designed conceptual solutions. For example, it is difficult to design and implement a functional and beautiful user interface with ease of use, while the difficulty is not essential.

1. In the article, Brooks summarized the essential difficulties into four irreducible categories: complexity, conformity, changeability and invisibility.
    1. **Complexity**: A software system is made of different components and the interaction logics between them. When the project scales up, the complexity increase faster than linearity. The difficulties in intelligent activities like software development is normally essential.
    1. **Conformity**: Unlike physicists, it is difficult for a group of software developers to match beliefs and methodologies. 
    1. **Changeability**: Software systems have to deal with constant changes. 
    1. **invisibility**: Software systems is built on virtual world instead of in space, thus it is not visible as buildings.
    
    Let’s take an online shopping website as an example. A large online store is designed for handling thousands of use cases, (**complexities**). The servers have to pass the load testing for the varying internet traffic, and the architecture of the system might need to be refactored for scaling up (**changeability**). The developers have to cooperate with people with different thought such as marketing officers and product managers. In a group of programmers even though, some might believe PHP is the best language for implementing the server, while others love python (**conformity**). When an error is reported from the customer services or the maintenance, the essential reason that caused the bug is sometimes difficult to discover because it is not visible and can only be located by logic and clever mind (**invisibility**).

1. According to the article, silver bullet in software engineering is a methodology, technology or management tectnique that can make an one order-of-magnitude improvement on the productivity, reliability and simplicity in the development of all sorts of software systems in 10 years. Due to Brooks' observation on the industy and the essential difficulties in building conceptual constructs for software systems, he believed that there is inherently no silver bullet for software engineering.  

1. In lecture, software engineering's relationship to computer science was described by analogy by discussing the differences between a chemist (chemistry) and a chemical engineer (chemical engineering). Define software engineering and its relationship to computer science; make use of the chemist vs. chemical engineer analogy when answering this question.

1. 
    * **abstractions**: Abstraction in software engineering is to establish a simpler level on top of details that are not necessary to know. The complex details are encapsulated, which can simplify the development and promise the reliability. Abstraction is significant for software engineering. For example, High-level programming languages like C++ and Java are based on abstractions. So does the data structures and libraries we use for programming. Without abstarction， the great progress on software engineering and computer science in the past decades would not happen.
    * **conversations**: Conversation is the way in which people who perform software engineering build the common believes，objectives, understanding and views on the projects. Conversation is important because we need to cooperate with others to implement a modern software system. Without conversation through discussion, documentation and test cases, we cannot cooperate well.
    * **specification**: Specification is the blueprint and plan for the engineers and it should be there before implementing anything. Specification is important for clearifying the project requirements, setting the budgets, assigning tasks, control the development life cycle and many other purposes.
    * **translation**: Translation in software engineering (S/E) means all works in S/E can be regarded as kinds of translation. This principle is important development life cycles in which a specification is translated for the next phases, a bigger problem is translated into smaller ones, and an abstractions is translated to the next level.
    * **iteration**: This principle indicates that all the works of software engineering should be accomplished step by step (development cycle). It is indispensable for the management of a large scale project. According to the preset schedule specification, developers iteratively implement new features, test the new version and deliver it.
