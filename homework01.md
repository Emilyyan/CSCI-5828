It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)

1. According to Brooks's illustration, essential difficulties are the difficulties caused by the inherent properties of software systems. In the article, Brooks summarized the properties into four irreducible categories: complexity, conformity, changeability and invisibility. Let’s take an online sale system as an example. It is designed for handling hundreds of use cases (complexities). The servers have to pass the load testing for the varying traffic, and the architecture of the system might need to be refactored for scaling up (changeability). The developers have to spend much efforts on cooperating with the marketing people and the product manager, and reviewing others’ codes with little comfort (conformity). When an error is reported from the customer services or the maintenance people, the bug is sometimes hard to find and locate (invisibility).

1. Define the term accidental difficulties as it is used by Brooks. Provide background and context with your answer and at least one example of an accidental difficulty.
1. List and briefly describe the four essential difficulties of developing software systems that Brooks identifies. Provide additional examples of each type of the four essential difficulties.
1. Define what Brooks means by a silver bullet and reconstruct his argument as to why he believes there is no silver bullet for software engineering.
1. In lecture, software engineering's relationship to computer science was described by analogy by discussing the differences between a chemist (chemistry) and a chemical engineer (chemical engineering). Define software engineering and its relationship to computer science; make use of the chemist vs. chemical engineer analogy when answering this question.
1. In lecture, we discussed the importance of the following concepts to software engineers: abstractions, conversations, specification, translation, and iteration. Define each of these concepts as they are related to software engineering and discuss their importance.
