1. According to Brooks's illustration, essential difficulties are the inevitable difficulties caused by the inherent properties of software systems. 

1. Define the term accidental difficulties as it is used by Brooks. Provide background and context with your answer and at least one example of an accidental difficulty.

1. In the article, Brooks summarized the essential difficulties into four irreducible categories: complexity, conformity, changeability and invisibility. 
    1. When a software entity is scaled up, we get a corresponding increase in the number of different elements. In most cases, these interact with each other in some non-linear fashion, such that the complexity of the whole increases much more than linearly.

  Let’s take an online shopping website as an example. A functional and reliable online store is designed for handling hundreds of use cases, such as logging in/out, shopping cart editting, secure checkout (**complexities**). The servers have to pass the load testing for the varying traffic, and the architecture of the system might need to be refactored for scaling up/down (**changeability**). The developers have to spend much efforts on cooperating with the marketing people and the product manager, and reviewing others’ codes from the past (**conformity**). When an error is reported from the customer services or the maintenance people, the essential reason that caused the bug is sometimes difficult to discover and locate (**invisibility**).

1. Define what Brooks means by a silver bullet and reconstruct his argument as to why he believes there is no silver bullet for software engineering.
1. In lecture, software engineering's relationship to computer science was described by analogy by discussing the differences between a chemist (chemistry) and a chemical engineer (chemical engineering). Define software engineering and its relationship to computer science; make use of the chemist vs. chemical engineer analogy when answering this question.
1. In lecture, we discussed the importance of the following concepts to software engineers: abstractions, conversations, specification, translation, and iteration. Define each of these concepts as they are related to software engineering and discuss their importance.
