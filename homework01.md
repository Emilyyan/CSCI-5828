1. According to Brooks' illustration, essential difficulties are the inevitable difficulties caused by the inherent properties of software systems, and met when developers try to construct conceptual solutions from abstract problems. For example, it is difficult to build a robot that behaves like human.

1. Accidental difficulties are those difficulties met when developers try to implement the designed conceptual solutions. For example, it is difficult to design and implement a functional and beautiful user interface with ease of use, while the difficulty is not essential.

1. In the article, Brooks summarized the essential difficulties into four irreducible categories: complexity, conformity, changeability and invisibility.
    1. **Complexity**: A software system is made of different components and the interaction logics between them. When the project scales up, the complexity increase faster than linearity. The difficulties in intelligent activities like software development is normally essential.
    1. **Conformity**: Unlike physicists, it is difficult for a group of software developers to match beliefs and methodologies. 
    1. **Changeability**: Software systems have to deal with constant changes. 
    1. **invisibility**: Software systems is built on virtual world instead of in space, thus it is not visible as buildings.
    
    Let’s take an online shopping website as an example. A large online store is designed for handling thousands of use cases, (**complexities**). The servers have to pass the load testing for the varying internet traffic, and the architecture of the system might need to be refactored for scaling up (**changeability**). The developers have to cooperate with people with different thought such as marketing officers and product managers. In a group of programmers even though, some might believe PHP is the best language for implementing the server, while others love python (**conformity**). When an error is reported from the customer services or the maintenance, the essential reason that caused the bug is sometimes difficult to discover because it is not visible and can only be located by logic and clever mind (**invisibility**).

1. According to the article, silver bullet in software engineering is a methodology, technology or management tectnique that can make an one order-of-magnitude improvement on the productivity, reliability and simplicity in the development of all sorts of software systems in 10 years. Due to Brooks' observation on the industy and the essential difficulties in building conceptual constructs for software systems, he believed that there is inherently no silver bullet for software engineering.  

1. In lecture, software engineering's relationship to computer science was described by analogy by discussing the differences between a chemist (chemistry) and a chemical engineer (chemical engineering). Define software engineering and its relationship to computer science; make use of the chemist vs. chemical engineer analogy when answering this question.
